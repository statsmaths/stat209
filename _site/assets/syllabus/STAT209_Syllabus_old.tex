\textbf{Description:} \vspace{6pt}

This course broadly covers the entire process of collecting,
cleaning, visualizing, modeling, and presenting datasets. It
has a MATH designation but is not a \textit{mathematics} course.
The focus is on applied statistics and data analysis
rather than a detailed study of symbolic mathematics. By the end
of the semester you will feel confident collecting, analyzing,
and writing about datasets from a variety of fields. You will be
able to use these skills to address data-driven problems in a wide
range of application domains.

\bigskip

\textbf{Computing:} \vspace{6pt}

To facilitate your ability to actually \textit{do} statistics,
nearly every class meeting will involve some form of computing.
No prior programming experience is assumed or required.

\medskip

We will use the \textbf{R} programming environment throughout the
semester. It is freely available for all major operating systems and
is pre-installed on many campus computers. You can download it and
all supporting files for your own machine via these links:
\begin{center}
\url{https://cran.r-project.org/} \\
\url{https://www.rstudio.com/}
\end{center}
The lab computers in Jepson are available and contain all of the
required software. I strongly recommend, however, downloading these
on your own machine so that you will be able to work on assignments
without needing to work only in the computer lab.

\bigskip

\textbf{Course Website:} \vspace{6pt}

All of the materials and assignments for the course will be posted
on the class website:
\begin{quote}
\url{https://statsmaths.github.io/stat209}
\end{quote}
The website contains notes, exam dates, assignment details, and
supplemental materials. At the end of the semester, this version of
the course will be archived and available for your reference.

\vspace{0.4cm}

\textbf{GitHub:} \vspace{6pt}

Your work for this semester will be submitted through GitHub,
the same platform that hosts our website, using the GitHub
classroom program. You will need to set up a free account, which
we will cover during the first week of class.

\newpage

\textbf{Learning Objectives (summary):} \vspace{6pt}

The following are twelve learning objectives that will be
covered throughout the semester. Each topic will be the
focus of one week of the course, with weeks 7 and 14 devoted
to reviewing prior material. You will be able to demonstrate
mastery of each objective via in-class examinations.

\begin{enumerate}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item reproducible computing
\item variable types and numeric summaries
\item the grammar of graphics
\item advanced graphics
\item filtering and summarizing data
\item statistical inference
\item communicating statistical results
\item normalized data
\item joining relational data
\item working with strings
\item text mining
\item ethical guidelines for statistical practice
\end{enumerate}

Additionally, the following four learning objectives cover
forms of presenting results from statistical analyses. These
topics will be folded into the semester at relevant points.

\begin{enumerate}\setlength\itemsep{0em} \setcounter{enumi}{12}
\item data dictionary with collected data
\item inferential data analysis with collected data
\item statistical argument with retrospective data
\item exploratory data analysis with gathered text data
\end{enumerate}
You will demonstrate these objectives via written data
reports.

\bigskip

\textbf{Labs:} \vspace{6pt}

Most class meetings will have an interactive lab associated with
it. These consist of a set of questions that must be answered with
either small snippets of code or short descriptive answers. You are
responsible for finishing the lab prior to the next class meeting
and uploading your answers to GitHub.

\bigskip

\textbf{First Assessment (objectives 1-12):} \vspace{6pt}

On nearly every Tuesday, there will be a short quiz covering
the material from the prior week. Note that this includes both
a conceptual understanding of the topics covered as well as the
ability to apply these concepts to data with code. Passing this
assessment yields a passing score for the respective learning
objective.

\newpage

\textbf{Second Assessment (objectives 1-12):} \vspace{6pt}

There will also be two chances for reassessment throughout the
semester. These are currently scheduled on the following two
class meetings (in the event of unforeseen circumstances, these
dates are subject to change):
\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item 2018-03-01 (Week 07)
\item 2018-04-26 (Week 14)
\end{itemize}
You will be able to answer a group of questions related to
learning objectives that were not successfully passed in the
first assessment. At a maximum, you will be able to reassess
only 4 of the 6 learning objectives in each half of the semester.

\bigskip

\textbf{Data Reports (objectives 13-16):} \vspace{6pt}

In order to demonstrate mastery of learning objectives 13-16,
you will also complete four data-oriented reports. These reports
are short written documents that mix code, graphics, and prose to
provide a comprehensive analysis of a data set. The tentative due
dates and topics for these reports are:
\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item 2018-02-15 (Week 05): data dictionary with collected data
\item 2018-03-22 (Week 09): inferential data analysis with collected data
\item 2018-03-29 (Week 11): statistical argument with retrospective data
\item 2018-04-26 (Week 14): exploratory data analysis with gathered text data
\end{itemize}
Reports that make a genuine effort to address the task at hand but
fail to meet all of the guidelines will be given detailed feedback.
There will be a short re-submission window in which modified reports
can be re-handed in for credit.

\bigskip

\textbf{Final Grades:} \vspace{6pt}

I believe that grades are meant to indicate how well students
were able to demonstrate their achievement of well-defined
learning goals. As described in the prior sections, all of the
work for this course will be graded as either a passing grade (P)
or a failing grade (I = insufficient). Your final grade is
generally determined by the following:
\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item \textbf{A} \quad Passing grades on 16/16 learning objectives
\item \textbf{A-} \quad Passing grades on 14/16 learning objectives
\item \textbf{B+} \quad Passing grades on 12/16 learning objectives
\item \textbf{B} \quad Passing grades on 10/16 learning objectives
\item \textbf{B-} \quad Passing grades on 9/16 learning objectives
\item \textbf{C} \quad Passing grades on 8/16 learning objectives
\end{itemize}
To pass the course, you must also (1) miss no more than four class
meetings and (2) miss no more than four lab assignments. Failing to
fulfill any of these requirements or achieving fewer than 8 of the
learning objectives may result in a failing grade for the course.

% To accomplish this goal, this I have implemented an adapted
% standards-based grading system for the course.

% \bigskip

% Labs (homework), reports, quizzes, and exams are graded  In some
% instances, particularly on exams, there will also be a grade of
% of a low-pass (LP). These scores, together with your attendance
% and course engagement, yield a final grade based on the following
% criteria.

% \begin{center}
% \begin{tabular}{p{2.5cm}|p{4cm}|p{4cm}|p{4cm}}
% & \quad \textbf{A} & \quad \textbf{B} & \quad \textbf{C} \\ \hline \hline
% \textbf{Participation} & actively present and engaged in almost all classes & actively present and engaged in most classes & actively present and engaged in most classes (miss at most 5)  \\ \hline
% \textbf{Labs} & passing grade on nearly all labs (missing no more than 2) & passing grade on most labs (missing no more than 4) & passing grade on the majority of labs (missing no more than 6) \\ \hline
% \textbf{Quizzes} & pass at least 7 quizzes & pass at least 5 quizzes & pass at least 3 quizzes \\ \hline
% \textbf{Reports} & pass all three reports & pass all three reports & pass at least two data analyses \\ \hline
% \textbf{Exams} & achieve a high-pass on both exams & achieve one high-pass and one pass on the exams & achieve passing scores on both exams\\ \hline
% \end{tabular}
% \end{center}

% You are allowed one `freebie' on these requirements; for example, you
% can get a B if you fail one data report but fulfill all other
% requirements. Note that failing to meet the requirements for a B will
% result in a grade no higher than a B; that is, you cannot typically
% make-up for performance in one area of the course with good performance
% in another. Failure to meet the requirements for a C may result in a
% failing grade for the term.

% \bigskip

% There is no hard rule for assigning pluses and minuses, but generally an
% A- is given for missing 2-3 requirements of an A and a B+ is given for
% missing 4-5 requirements. Similar rules apply for receiving grades of
% a B- or C+.

\bigskip

\textbf{Class Policies:} \vspace{6pt}

The following class policies address some of the most common
questions and concerns that students have. If anything is
unclear, please feel free to contact me for clarification at
any point in the semester.

\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item \textbf{Academic honesty:} Cheating and plagiarism are grave scholarly
offenses and potential grounds
for expulsion; they are also a major barrier to your intellectual development.
You are expected to familiarize yourself with the entirety of the
University of Richmond’s Honor Code. If you are confused or unsure about
appropriate citation protocol or any other aspect of the Honor code,
please consult me before turning in an assignment.
\item \textbf{Special approval:} If you have special approval forms for extra
time on exams or any other circumstances I should know about, please speak
with me as early as possible so that we can best accommodate your needs.
\item \textbf{Late work:} You are expected to submit all work on-time. Late labs
and reports will not be considered; always hand in something even if it is not
perfect.
\item \textbf{Attendance:} You are expected to both attend and participate in most
class meetings. If you must be absent due to illness or other pressing
need, please let me know by email as soon as possible. A habit of arriving
late is considered equivalent to an absence.
\item \textbf{Make-up work:} There are generally no make-up examinations.
In instances where students have a valid excuse for missing a quiz or
examination, please arrange to meet with me as soon as possible. I will
assess mastery of learning objectives by an oral examination.
\item \textbf{Class conduct:} During class I expect you to refrain from checking
email, being on phones, or working on assignments for other classes.
\item \textbf{Computers:} During programming assignments started in class, I expect you
to use the computers in the lab. This is helpful for several reasons: it
reduces distractions from iMessages and other materials on your laptop;
all of the lab computers are configured using the same software and language
set-up, reducing errors specific to your machine; and, other students and
myself can share the same screen without worrying about modifying something
on your personal machine.
\item \textbf{Office hours}: If you would like to meet during my office hours,
please just come by. No need to schedule an appointment. If you find me in
my office at other times of the week, I am usually glad to meet then as well.
Finally, I am also happy to make appointments outside of my normal
office hours. These appointments are meant for discussing
longer issues that are not appropriate for regular office hours (i.e., asking
for recommendation letters or discussing an extended absence) or for students
who cannot make my normal office hours. Please note that appointments should
be booked at least 24 hours ahead of time.
\item \textbf{Email:} I will also answer questions by email (it can, in fact,
be much faster than scheduling an appointment for small issues). During the
week, I aim to respond within 24 hours, with emails sent over the weekend
responded to by Monday morning. If your question involves code, please attach
your current lab or report as that will expedite my answering your question(s).

  differentiate between numeric and categorical data
\item
  treating numeric data as categorical data
\item
  create categorical variables by grouping numeric data
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\underline{Week 03, The Grammar of Graphics:}

system for the creation of statistical graphics. Putting the topics
together allow for the construction of arbitrarily complex
visualizations of data.
\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item
  the basic data aesthetics (x, y, label, color, size, and alpha)
\item
  the \textbf{ggplot2} syntax
\item
  mapping variables to aesthetics
\item
  setting fixed aesthetics

\bigskip

\underline{Week 05, Filtering and Summarizing Data:}
Often, data is given or found in a different format than is required for
an analysis. In this unit, we study techniques for filtering and
restructuring data. One particular focus is the study of how to
change the \textit{level of analysis} of a data set, such as taking
data originally about individuals and turning it into a dataset to
study cities or counties.
\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item
  syntax of the filter command
\item
  boolean variables
\item
  binary operators: ``and'', ``or''
\item
  binary operators: greater than, less than
\item
  set containment
\item
  random subsets
\item
  syntax of the summarize command
\item
  counting grouped data
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\underline{Week 06, Statistical Inference:}
Given a sample of data taken from a larger population, we can use
models to estimate how well the sample resembles the entire population.
This unit covers an introduction to these techniques, known as statistical
inference. The same techniques can be used to study the outcome of random
processes.
\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item
  sample and population statistics
\item
  independence
\item
  standard errors

\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\underline{Spring Break}

\bigskip

\underline{Week 09, Normalized Data:}
In this unit, we will explore and implement best practices for collecting and
organizing data.
\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}

  composite keys
\item
  inner and outer joins
\item
  filtering joins
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\underline{Week 11, Working with strings:}
