{\bf Project 01 - Rubric} \\
\end{center}

\bigskip

This rubric will be used to grade your submission for the first
project. Please pay attention to the rubric and make sure you have
followed all of the instructions. Note that the relationship between
points and letter grades may not follow the standard conventions
(that is, 90\% may not be an A-), and generally components will not
receive partial credit.
