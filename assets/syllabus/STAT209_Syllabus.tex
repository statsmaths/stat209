\textbf{Description:} \vspace{6pt}

This course broadly covers the entire process of collecting,
cleaning, visualizing, modeling, and presenting datasets. It
has a MATH designation but is not a \textit{mathematics} course.
The focus is on applied statistics and data analysis
rather than a detailed study of symbolic mathematics. By the end
of the semester you will feel confident collecting, analyzing,
and writing about datasets from a variety of fields. You will be
able to use these skills to address data-driven problems in a wide
range of application domains.

\bigskip

\textbf{Computing:} \vspace{6pt}

To facilitate your ability to actually \textit{do} statistics,
most class meetings will involve some form of computing.
No prior programming experience is assumed or required.

\medskip

We will use the \textbf{R} programming environment throughout the
semester. It is freely available for all major operating systems and
is pre-installed on many campus computers. You can download it and
all supporting files for your own machine via these links:
\begin{center}
\url{https://cran.r-project.org/} \\
\url{https://www.rstudio.com/}
\end{center}
The lab computers in Jepson are available and contain all of the
required software. I strongly recommend, however, downloading these
on your own machine so that you will be able to work on assignments
without needing to work only in the computer lab.

\bigskip

\textbf{Course Website:} \vspace{6pt}

All of the materials and assignments for the course will be posted
on the class website:
\begin{quote}
\url{https://statsmaths.github.io/stat209}
\end{quote}
The website contains notes, assignment details, and
supplemental materials. At the end of the semester, this version of
the course will be archived and available for your reference.

\vspace{0.4cm}

\textbf{GitHub:} \vspace{6pt}

Your work for this semester will be submitted through GitHub,
the same platform that hosts our website, using the GitHub
classroom program. You will need to set up a free account, which
we will cover during the first several week of class.

\newpage

\textbf{In-Class Assessments (quizzes):} \vspace{6pt}

On most Tuesdays, there will be a short assessment covering
the material from the prior week. Note that this includes both
a conceptual understanding of the topics covered as well as the
ability to apply these concepts to data with code. I will provide
details on the class website with the exact topics on each assessment.

\bigskip

\textbf{Data Projects:} \vspace{6pt}

While the assessments serve to make sure you are following along
with the general concepts, the core aim of the course is to teach
you how to \textit{apply} statistics to real-world questions. To
this end, we will complete several data-oriented projects.
These projects consist of short written documents that mix code,
graphics, and prose to provide a comprehensive analysis of a data set.

\bigskip

\textbf{Final Grades:} \vspace{6pt}

The in-class assessments, of which there will ten, are graded on
a strictly pass/fail basis. The whole of these are converted into
a letter grade according to how many you have passed:
\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item \textbf{A} \quad \quad \quad Passing 9/10 assessments
\item \textbf{A-/B+} \quad Passing 8/10 assessments
\item \textbf{B} \quad \quad \quad Passing 7/10 assessments
\item \textbf{B-/C+} \quad Passing 6/10 assessments
\item \textbf{C} \quad \quad \quad Passing 5/10 assessments
\item \textbf{D} \quad \quad \quad Passing 4/10 assessments
\end{itemize}
Your projects will receive a letter grade according to a rubric that
I will distribute ahead of the due-date. The final grade will be
determined by weighting the assessments and projects as follows:
\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item \textbf{Projects}: 67\%
\item \textbf{Assessments}: 33\%
\end{itemize}
To pass the course, you must also miss no more than four class meetings.
Attendance requires that you arrive on-time, complete any out of class
assignments for the day, and fully engage with the course material.
Failing to fulfill these attendance requirements may result in a failing
grade for the course.

% To accomplish this goal, this I have implemented an adapted
% standards-based grading system for the course.

% \bigskip

% Labs (homework), reports, quizzes, and exams are graded  In some
% instances, particularly on exams, there will also be a grade of
% of a low-pass (LP). These scores, together with your attendance
% and course engagement, yield a final grade based on the following
% criteria.

% \begin{center}
% \begin{tabular}{p{2.5cm}|p{4cm}|p{4cm}|p{4cm}}
% & \quad \textbf{A} & \quad \textbf{B} & \quad \textbf{C} \\ \hline \hline
% \textbf{Participation} & actively present and engaged in almost all classes & actively present and engaged in most classes & actively present and engaged in most classes (miss at most 5)  \\ \hline
% \textbf{Labs} & passing grade on nearly all labs (missing no more than 2) & passing grade on most labs (missing no more than 4) & passing grade on the majority of labs (missing no more than 6) \\ \hline
% \textbf{Quizzes} & pass at least 7 quizzes & pass at least 5 quizzes & pass at least 3 quizzes \\ \hline
% \textbf{Reports} & pass all three reports & pass all three reports & pass at least two data analyses \\ \hline
% \textbf{Exams} & achieve a high-pass on both exams & achieve one high-pass and one pass on the exams & achieve passing scores on both exams\\ \hline
% \end{tabular}
% \end{center}

% You are allowed one `freebie' on these requirements; for example, you
% can get a B if you fail one data report but fulfill all other
% requirements. Note that failing to meet the requirements for a B will
% result in a grade no higher than a B; that is, you cannot typically
% make-up for performance in one area of the course with good performance
% in another. Failure to meet the requirements for a C may result in a
% failing grade for the term.

% \bigskip

% There is no hard rule for assigning pluses and minuses, but generally an
% A- is given for missing 2-3 requirements of an A and a B+ is given for
% missing 4-5 requirements. Similar rules apply for receiving grades of
% a B- or C+.

\bigskip

\textbf{Class Policies:} \vspace{6pt}

The following class policies address some of the most common
questions and concerns that students have. If anything is
unclear, please feel free to contact me for clarification at
any point in the semester.

\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item \textbf{Academic honesty:} Cheating and plagiarism are grave scholarly
offenses and potential grounds
for expulsion; they are also a major barrier to your intellectual development.
You are expected to familiarize yourself with the entirety of the
University of Richmond’s Honor Code. If you are confused or unsure about
appropriate citation protocol or any other aspect of the Honor code,
please consult me before turning in an assignment.
\item \textbf{Special approval:} If you have special approval forms for extra
time on exams or any other circumstances I should know about, please speak
with me as early as possible so that we can best accommodate your needs.
\item \textbf{Late work:} You are expected to submit all work on-time. Late
reports will not be considered; always hand in something even if it is not perfect.
\item \textbf{Attendance:} You are expected to both attend and participate in most
class meetings. If you must be absent due to illness or other pressing
need, please let me know by email as soon as possible. A habit of arriving
late, failing to participate, or failing to accomplish any out of class assignments
is considered equivalent to an absence.
\item \textbf{Make-up work:} In instances where students have a valid excuse for
missing a quiz, please arrange to meet with me as soon as possible.
\item \textbf{Class conduct:} During class I expect you to refrain from checking
email, being on phones, or working on assignments for other classes.
\item \textbf{Computers:} During programming assignments started in class, I expect you
to use the computers in the lab. This is helpful for several reasons: it
reduces distractions from iMessages and other materials on your laptop;
all of the lab computers are configured using the same software and language
set-up, reducing errors specific to your machine; and, other students and
myself can share the same screen without worrying about modifying something
on your personal machine.
\item \textbf{Office hours}: If you would like to meet during my office hours,
please just come by. No need to schedule an appointment. If you find me in
my office at other times of the week, I am usually glad to meet then as well.
Finally, I am also happy to make appointments outside of my normal
office hours. These appointments are meant for discussing
longer issues that are not appropriate for regular office hours (i.e., asking
for recommendation letters or discussing an extended absence) or for students
who cannot make my normal office hours. Please note that appointments should
be booked at least 24 hours ahead of time.
\item \textbf{Email:} I will also answer questions by email (it can, in fact,
be much faster than scheduling an appointment for small issues). During the
week, I aim to respond within 24 hours, with emails sent over the weekend
responded to by Monday morning. If your question involves code, please attach
your current lab or report as that will expedite my answering your question(s).
