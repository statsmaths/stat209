For this class period we will not be formally meeting. Before the next class
I expect you to finish the following lab:
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statsmaths/stat209/master/labs/lab11.Rmd" download="lab11.Rmd" target="_blank">lab11.Rmd</a>

Upload your script to GitHub ahead of the next class. It will be graded as
a quiz (as long you complete all of the sections you should expect to pass).
