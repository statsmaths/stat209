For the first in-class assessment, you should
be able to:

- example the major points of the course syllabus,
particularly the policies for attendance, final
grades, and late work
- be able to describe in a few sentences the big
picture of the "What is Statistics article"
- give an example from the datasets that we saw in
class of the three general EDA observations: pattern
description, anomaly detection,  and perspective
- define EDA (the process of trying to understand a
dataset without a particular agenda at stake)

This first assessment is easy to pass if you take
a few minutes to review and easy to fail if you
don't!
