Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the process of trying to
understand a dataset without a particular agenda at stake.
It is a very important aspect of data analysis and will contribute
a large part of what we work on this semester.

### Today

It will take a few weeks before we have covered all of the core
skills needed to do an exploratory analysis of a dataset. We'll get
there eventually, but I think it is useful to see at the start what
exactly is involved in such an analysis. So, today, we will be
looking at some online, interactive visualizations that we can
explore without involving R or any data processing skills.

### Types of data sets

When I talk about data I tend to think of a broader meaning to the
term than some people might. Data can include such things as text:

- [Google search suggestions by country](https://noahveltman.com/suggest/)

Maps:

- [NYC Taxi's: A Day in the Life](http://chriswhong.github.io/nyctaxi/)

And here, even one with sound:

- [Off the Staff](https://www.c82.net/offthestaff/)
- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLw6QMmIiPBlU_dElMDoJn4RUBvpp_bUwi&v=DxkpN4PUOzA)

Today the projects groups will look at will cover a similarly wide range of
data set types.

### Exploratory data analysis

What's the point an exploratory, visual analysis? At a high level we are
trying to understand something about the world around us. The EDA phase of
analysis let's us discover what the data at hand is specifically telling us
and indicates directions for future studies.

Here is a project from the Digital Scholarship Lab (DSL) at the University of
Richmond that does a great job of showing how visualizations can be powerful
argumentative tools:

- [Forced Migration of Enslaved People](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/forcedmigration/)

If you are not familiar with the DSL, I encourage you to check out their
projects and visit the group's space in the library. I plan to have
someone from the DSL join us for a class later in the semester.

### Modes of Analysis in EDA

Generally, when doing EDA we are looking at understanding patterns
contained within the data. I tend see that interesting observations
come in one of three forms:

- *pattern description*: an observation about a general pattern
or trend found in the dataset
- *anomaly detection*: identification of data points that, in some
way, seem to not follow the general pattern or otherwise behave
in some extreme or anomalous way
- *perspective*: we have a special interest in a small set of data
points (often just one) and are interested in how this point falls
relative to the rest of the data; like anomaly detection, but we
decide which points to care about ahead of the analysis

These do not function in a vacuum and good analyses will often pull
from multiple types of observations.

### Questions

For today, here are some questions to answer about as we look at interactive
visualizations:

1. What is the source of the data?
2. What types of visualizations are being used?
3. What are 2-3 interesting observations you found in the dataset?

I'll answer these for the Forced Migration dataset, then let you work on these
questions in small groups.

### Groups

Now, its your turn. I have gather several interactive visualizations
that I find particularly interesting. You'll be split into groups of
about 3 people and assigned one of these datasets.

- [A Day in the Life](http://flowingdata.com/2015/12/15/a-day-in-the-life-of-americans/)
- [Visualizing MBTA Data](http://mbtaviz.github.io/)
- [The Wizardsâ€™ shooting stars](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/sports/wizards-shooting-stars/)
- [The Voting Habits of Americans Like You](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/06/10/upshot/voting-habits.html)
- [The Rhythm of Food](http://rhythm-of-food.net/#explore)
- [Executive Abroad](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/executiveabroad/)
- [Foreign Born Population (1850-2000)](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/foreignborn/)
- [#SOTU2014: See the State of The Union address minute by minute on Twitter](http://twitter.github.io/interactive/sotu2014/#p1)
- [A Map of Baseball Nation](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/04/24/upshot/facebook-baseball-map.html)

Spend about 15 minutes playing around with the visualization and
understanding the data within it. Then, answer the four questions above.
Finally, designate one person to come up and explain the answers to your
dataset.

## Assignment

For next class, please read the introduction to the text *The Art
of Data Science* by Roger Peng and Elizabeth Matsui:

- [The Art of Data Science](../assets/pdfs/art-of-data-science.pdf)

This should be a quick and easy read. It will help frame the discussion of the
steps involved in making use of data in an analysis.
