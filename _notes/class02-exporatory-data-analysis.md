Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the process of trying to
understand a dataset without a particular agenda at stake.
It is a very important aspect of data analysis and will contribute
a large part of what we work on this semester.

### Today

It will take a few weeks before we have covered all of the basic
skills needed to do an exploratory analysis of a dataset. We'll get
there eventually, but I think it is useful to see at the start what
exactly is involved in such an analysis. So, today, we will be
looking at some online, interactive visualizations that we can
explore without involving R or any data processing skills.

### Together

When I talk about data I tend to think of a broader meaning to the
term than most people might. Data can include such things as text,
images, maps and sound. Here is one with text:

- [Google search suggestions by country](https://noahveltman.com/suggest/)

Maps:

- [NYC Taxi's: A Day in the Life](http://chriswhong.github.io/nyctaxi/)
- [Forced Migration of Enslaved People](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/forcedmigration/)

And even sound:

- [Off the Staff](https://www.c82.net/offthestaff/)
- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLw6QMmIiPBlU_dElMDoJn4RUBvpp_bUwi&v=DxkpN4PUOzA)

What's the point of all this exploratory analysis? At a high level
we are trying to understand something about the world around us.
The EDA phase of analysis let's us discover what the data at hand
is specifically telling us and indicates directions for future
studies.

### Groups

Now, its your turn. I have gather several interactive visualizations
that I find particularly interesting. You'll be split into groups of
about 3 people and assigned one of these datasets.

- [A Day in the Life](http://flowingdata.com/2015/12/15/a-day-in-the-life-of-americans/)
- [Visualizing MBTA Data](http://mbtaviz.github.io/)
- [The Wizardsâ€™ shooting stars](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/sports/wizards-shooting-stars/)
- [The Voting Habits of Americans Like You](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/06/10/upshot/voting-habits.html)
- [The Rhythm of Food](http://rhythm-of-food.net/#explore)
- [Executive Abroad](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/executiveabroad/)
- [Foreign Born Population (1850-2000)](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/foreignborn/)
- [#SOTU2014: See the State of The Union address minute by minute on Twitter](http://twitter.github.io/interactive/sotu2014/#p1)
- [A Map of Baseball Nation](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/04/24/upshot/facebook-baseball-map.html)

Spend about 15 minutes playing around with the visualization and
understanding the data within it. Then, pull out 1-2 of the most
interesting patterns that you found and think about what type of
article or further analysis you would want to do to extrapolate
on this (a few already do a bit of this work for you; try to find
a pattern that was not made explicit in the text). Finally, designate
one person to come up and explain the dataset and show something
interesting that you've found.

### Modes of Analysis in EDA

Generally, we doing EDA we are looking at understanding patterns
contained within the data. I tend see that interesting observations
come in one of three forms:

- *pattern description*: an observation about a general pattern
or trend found in the dataset
- *anomaly detection*: identification of data points that, in some
way, seem to not follow the general pattern or otherwise behave
in some extreme or anomalous way
- *perspective*: we have a special interest in a small set of data
points (often just one) and are interested in how this point falls
relative to the rest of the data; like anomaly detection, but we
decide which points to care about ahead of the analysis

These do not function in a vacuum and good analyses will often pull
from multiple types of observations.

## Assignment

For next class, please read the introduction to the text *The Art
of Data Science* by Roger Peng and Elizabeth Matsui:

- [The Art of Data Science](../assets/pdfs/art-of-data-science.pdf)

This should be a quick and easy read. It will help frame the discussion of the
steps involved in making use of data in an analysis.
