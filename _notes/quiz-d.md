The fourth in-class assessment will consist of a single question. I will show
you a plot and ask you to write the **ggplot2** that would generate the plot.
This is not an easy task, as I will pick a plot with a lot of elements,
which may include:

- a `geom_point` layer
- a `geom_text` layer (note: you will have to set the `label` aesthetic)
- changing the color of the points to a fixed value
- changing the color of the points to a value defined by another variable
- changing the size of the points to scale with another variable

To get a passing grade, all but one line of the code should be perfect and the
remaining line should require only a minor modification
