### Tabular data formats

In this course we will store data in a tabular format.
These tables will have **observations** stored in rows and
**variables** stored in columns. The individual elements are
called **values**. So, each row represents a
particular object in our dataset and each column represents
some feature of the objects.

Let's look at the births dataset again from last time:

```{r}
library(readr)
births <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statsmaths/stat_data/gh-pages/arbuthnot.csv")
births
```

The observations here are *years* and the variables are: `head_of_state`,
`year`, `boys`, `girls`, `total`, and `boy_to_girl_ratio`. Each variable
measures something about a given observation. What exactly
constitutes a row of the data is called a **unit of analysis**.
Keeping in mind what the unit of analysis is will be very
important as we think about how data is being used.

### Comma separated values

The type of R object that stores such a dataset is called a
**data frame**. Data frames store tabular data for us within R. We also
need a way to store tabular data as a file. One option would be to store
data as Google sheets or Excel file. While these programs are
great for data input, it is not a good idea to store raw data in
these formats. Instead, we want a minimal **plain text** format.
That is, the file should be readable by any basic text editor.

The plan text data format that we will use is called a
**comma-separated values** or CSV file. In this format, each
column of the data is (as the name suggests) separated by a
comma. Every observation is stored on its own row. The first
row gives the names of the columns. Here are what the first few
rows of the births dataset look like stored as a CSV file:

```
head_of_state,year,boys,girls,total,boy_to_girl_ratio
Charles I,1629,5218,4683,9901,1.114
Charles I,1630,4858,4457,9315,1.09
Charles I,1631,4422,4102,8524,1.078
Charles I,1632,4994,4590,9584,1.088
Charles I,1633,5158,4839,9997,1.066
Charles I,1634,5035,4820,9855,1.045
```

A CSV file can be created and read by R, Excel, GoogeSheets,
OpenOffice, and most other data processing and statistical tools.
It is one of the most common formats that you will see data stored
as online. By convention, a CSV file has the extension ".csv".

As we have seen, we can read a dataset using the `read_csv` function. The
function either takes a URL, as we have above, or a path to the file on your
computer. We will test out the second example now.

### Activity: Data creation

We are now going to collect some data as a class. Specifically, you will each
record information about your four favorite restaurants:

  - name of the restaurant
  - location
  - cuisine
  - favorite dish
  - cost of a typical meal per person
  - how many times you visit each year
  - last time that you visited

Let's start by doing this on the white boards and we will then collect this
as a class and store it as a CSV file (I'll explain these steps in person).

### Reading in a local file

Once we have collectively downloaded the file `fav_restaurants.csv`, place it
someone on your computer's Desktop. To read the file in using the computers
in the lab, you will need to run the following command:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
food <- read_csv("C:\\Users\\Public\\Desktop\fav_restaurants.csv")
```

Notice that I have called it something short but memorable to make it easier
to write code about the dataset. If you are later doing this on MacOS, try
this instead:

```{r}
food <- read_csv("~/Desktop/fav_restaurants.csv")
```

That should work on any Mac. If you have a windows computer with a different
set-up, you may need a slightly different path. I am happy to assist with this
when we start working on the projects.

### Simple plotting, again

Recall that we can create plots with the `qplot` function from the **ggplot2**
package. Specifically, we use something like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(food, aes(cuisine)) +
  geom_bar()
```

To get a bar plot of the cuisine types. Or,

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(food, aes(year, cost)) +
  geom_point()
```

For a scatter plot of how often you visit each year and the average cost.
Are there any surprises in using these commands to create plots? 

### Assignment

I have posted a file called `lab04.R`. Open this in R, follow the instructions,
and complete for the next class.

For next class, please just come prepared for the next assessment. Note that
this one will require you to be able to write R code from memory, an important
skill (having to look up every single command stops us from getting in the
flow of doing exploratory work).
