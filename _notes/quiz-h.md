For this in-class assessment, you should be able to understand the following
concepts. You should be able to compute them for a small dataset or use R
commands to produce them from a larger dataset:

- mean
- median
- quantiles (quartiles, deciles, ventiles, and percentiles)
- variance (`var`)
- standard deviation (`sd`)

You should also be able to read the output of the function `reg_table` and
and estimate the standard deviation of a variable.
