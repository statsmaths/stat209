For this assessment I will give you two regression tables, one where a
response is predicted from a categorical variable and another where the
response comes from another numeric variable (a linear regression). You
should be able to do the following things with them:

- make predictions for new data points by hand
- understand which variables are significant by looking at their confidence
intervals
- compare the predictive power of two models using the R-squared metric
