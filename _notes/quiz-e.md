The next assessment will serve double purpose as both an assessment and a lab.
We will not meet as a class on Tuesday, 2018-02-20. Instead I will post
`Lab11.Rmd` on the website. Prior to the next class you should compete and
upload the completed lab. You will be able to work on these with any notes
or resources you would like, though I expect you to work on it on your own
and not consult anyone else's final results.
