## Thesis Statement

You have certainly heard of a thesis statement, but may struggle
to formally define what it is. A thesis statement:

> offers a concise summary of the main point or claim of the essay,
> research paper

A hypothesis, which is not the same concept, is:

> a supposition or proposed explanation made on the basis of
> limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation

That is, a hypothesis is a fixed explanation of something. A
thesis is a particular rhetorical element that exists within a
document or speech and is intended for a particular audience.
If you are designing an experiment or collecting data, you will
have a hypothesis. When you are writing a paper or giving a
presentation you will have a thesis (and that thesis may help to
confirm or contradict a prior hypothesis).

## Types of Argumentation

Within logical arguments, there are two subtypes that
have a place in making arguments from data. These are:

- **deductive reasoning**
- **inductive reasoning**

In deductive reasoning we start with general assumptions and
show that certain conclusions logically follow from them. A
classic example is:

> Socrates is a man. All men are mortal. Therefore, Socrates is
> mortal.

If the assumptions of this statement (first two sentences) are
true, the conclusions **must** be true.

Inductive reasoning, in contrast, builds a conclusion by inferring
based on patterns seen in particular examples. For instance:

> I have taught a total of 700 students over the past 5 years. I
> enjoyed teaching all 700 of them. Therefore, I enjoy teaching all
> students.

While the data provides strong evidence for the conclusion, it does
not guarantee its validity even if the assumptions and logic is
infallible.

## Data-Driven Logical Arguments

Deductive reasoning occurs in statistics when some of our
facts (assumptions) are derived from an analysis of a dataset.
Generally this occurs when we are drawing data from a particular
population. For example, say we are looking at election results
from every county in the United States. The following is a
deductive argument:

> A presidential candidate that has more than 270 electoral votes
> wins the election (assumption). Candidate A had 300 elector votes
> in 2020 (assumption derived from data). Therefore, candidate A
> won the election.

Notice that often not **all** facts are derived from data, but
often some of them are. Inductive reasoning usually occurs in
statistics when sampling from a larger population or observing a
random process. For example:

> Only 1 of the 1000 patients injected with the vaccine had serious
> side-effects. Therefore, the vaccine is safe for distribution.

While inductive reasoning is more traditionally associated with
statistics, the deductive case is quite common in both industry
and academia.

## Hybrid Approach in Statistics

Often, in an analysis of data I have observed a hybrid approach.
Namely, deductive reasoning is used to draw concrete conclusions
from data. These conclusions are then used as part of a larger
inductive reasoning.

For example, assume that you are a statistician working for a large
company and analyzing financial data. Using the data, you may
confirm that the company has increased year-over-year profits by
232% (by deductive reasoning). From this evidence, the company
decided to proceed with an IPO (by inductive reasoning).

Furthermore, these two logical approaches are also blended with
aspects of ethos and pathos. These can occur in non-obvious ways.
For example, I may draw on my own authority as a Ph.D. statistician
to assert that a particular model is appropriate to apply in a given
situation. This model is then used to establish a thesis by inductive
reason that plays on the audience's emotions.
