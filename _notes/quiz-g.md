This assessment will focus on your ability to use the factor commands and
make use the `group_summarize` function. The assessment will be five
multiple choice questions (so you do not need to write code yourself),
how you will need to both understand the functions as well as broadly know
the correct syntax. Specific items are:

- understand what `cut`, `factor`, and `bin` are used for (and why you
would use them)
- understand the **forcats** functions `fct_lump` and `fct_infreq` as 
well as when to use them
- understand the concept of using `group_summarize` and the syntax for
calling it across one or more groups

Note that while multiple choice makes the assessment slightly easier in
some ways, it does eliminate entirely the possibility of partial credit
so make sure that you prepare ahead of time!
