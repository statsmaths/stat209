**Due**: 2018-02-20 (start of class)

**Starter code**: [project-a.Rmd](https://github.com/statsmaths/stat209/blob/master/projects/project-a.Rmd)

**Rubric**: [project-a-rubric.csv](https://github.com/statsmaths/stat209/blob/master/projects/project-a-rubric.csv)

The overarching goal of the first project is to collect a
data set, produce a data dictionary, and provide a basic
exploration of the variables from your data.

Please take note of the rubric linked to above before submitting your report.
Make sure you have followed all of the instructions. Note that the
relationship between points and letter grades may not follow the standard
conventions (that is, 90\% may not be an A-), and generally components will
not receive partial credit.

The first step is to decide what data set you would like to collect. The most
important aspect of choosing your dataset is to pick something that has an
overarching object of study. This is an exploratory analysis (EDA), so this
does not mean a concrete yes/no question; rather, you should have a general
theme of interest that you want to understanding. For example, you should not
have a question such as "do male students typically eat later than female
students?". Instead, you should have a question along the lines of: "what
patterns exist in the dining times of UR students?".

Your data set should follow these specifications:

- at least 75 observations
- at least 5 variables, with:
    - at least 2 numeric variables
    - at least one character variable of categories
    - at least one variable that you physically collect yourself
- be uploaded to GitHub as a CSV file along with your report

This is a chance to do something creative. Here are just a
few suggestions:

- pick a favorite magazine and collect data about the ads:
what pages are they on; what's the product; how many words are
there; how many people are in the ad (ect).
- sit on a bench somewhere during a busy time of day and count
how many people walk in two minute intervals in each direction
past you; create a categorical flag for whether someone asks
what you're doing
- make a dataset with one observation for various family and
friends; record the last date you saw each person; give each
person a score from 1 to 10 for how much you like them
- watch TV for a few hours and collect data about the ads:
product in question; time of the ad; length of the add (ect.)
- make a desperate plea on social media for data (hopefully you
have more than 75 friends); append a column for how well you
know each person

You're not restricted to these ideas. In fact, I encourage you
to find other interesting things to discover. For details on
the format of the report and how it will be graded, please see
the rubric and starter code.
