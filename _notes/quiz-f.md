This assessment will focus on your ability to filter a dataset using the
`filter` function. Specifically, you should be able to:

- filter based on a numeric variable by using the `>`, `>=`, and `<=` symbols
- filter based on numeric or categorical variables using `==` (equals) and
`!=` (not equals)
- be able to use the `%in%` (contained in) operator correctly; remember that
you need to use the function `c()` to describe the variables we are filtering
on

For this assessment you **do no** need to memorize the commands for filtering
dates and date times. These are useful, but I won't hold you to remembering
them without your notes.
