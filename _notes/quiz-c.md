For the third in-class assessment, you should be able to:

- compute the mean, median, percentiles, variance, and
standard deviation of small datasets by hand
- compute the mean, median, percentiles, variance, and
standard deviation of small datasets by calling functions
in R
- determine when the median would differ greatly from the
mean
- apply the 66% and 95% rules for the standard deviation
to numeric data; this includes the reverse: looking at a
or percentiles and determining the standard deviation
from them

If I ask you do arithmetic, it will be either very easy to
compute the answer or you can leave it unsimplified. No
calculators are needed or allowed.
