The format of the third in-class assessment differs from the first two (and
most of the remaining assessments). Rather than pen and paper, this assessment
will be done on the lab computers. Also, I'll give you about 40 minutes to
complete it instead of the usual 15.

Specifically, I will give you a very small dataset to construct in Excel. You
will need to export this file into a CSV format and then open a new RMarkdown
file. In this file you will have to load R packages, read the dataset, and
produce two simple plots (a scatter plot and a barplot) using the `ggplot`
commands. Finally, you'll email me the completed dataset, markdown file, and
HTML file.

All of these steps must be done with no notes or access to other digital
resources.
