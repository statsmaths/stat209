For the third in-class assessment, you should
be able to:

- identify and describe the difference between numeric and character variables
- accurately produce a full data dictionary for a dataset
- understand what makes a character variable a categorical one
- understand the naming rules for variables (no capital letters, no arbitrary
numbers, no spaces or other special characters, underscores in place of spaces
)
- be able to write the **ggplot2** command to build a simple scatter plot
(`geom_point`) from a data frame

Remember that, as was the case with Assessment B, you will be expected to
produce R code not just select the correct answers from a multiple choice list
of options.
