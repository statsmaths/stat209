For the third in-class assessment, you should
be familiar with the syntax and ideas behind
the following:

- loading an R package (use `library(packagename)`)
- draw a scatterplot of two variables, for example:
```{r}
ggplot(births, aes(year, girls)) +
  geom_point()
```
- loading a CSV file into R (using `read_csv`)
- describe the layout of a CSV file; you should be able
to construct one from hand based on a description of a dataset
- identify and describe observations (rows), variables (columns)
and know that these are stored in a data frame

The assessment includes fill in the blank questions, not
just multiple choice, so make sure you remember the specific
function commands (`library`, `read_csv`, ect.).
